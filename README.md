* This algorithm uses bit avalanche technology, so that the ciphertext becomes very large until infinity.
* The same password can be used forever without change.
* Of course, there is no password too. However, there must be random numbers.
* The encryption algorithm of this program adopts the algorithm of "JunTai" distribution random number, but the decryption algorithm does not use it.
* The so-called "JunTai" distribution refers to the disorderly distribution of each number on the axis of the number, its value appears only once without repetition.

* It's just a demo version, with the official version, enhanced version and final version.
* If you want to source code of official version or enhanced version or final version, please contact me.
* I hope who can crack this algorithm one day in my lifetime.
* If you break this algorithm, please let me know. Thank you very so much!
