* This algorithm uses bit avalanche technology, so that the ciphertext becomes very large until infinity.
* The same password can be used forever without change. Of course, there is no password too. However, there must be random numbers.
* The encryption algorithm of this source adopts the "JunTai"(like Shuffle) distribution random number algorithm, but the decryption algorithm does not use it.
* The so-called "JunTai" distribution random number algorithm refers to: each number (integer or real number) is distributed disorderly on the number axis, its value appears only once without repetition.

* It's just a demo version, the official version includes lower version, intermediate version and advanced version.
* If you want to source code of official version, please contact me.
* I hope who can crack this algorithm one day in my lifetime.
* If you break this algorithm, please let me know. Thank you very so much!

* Compiled on MacOS, Linux and *BSD in X86_64 platform.
