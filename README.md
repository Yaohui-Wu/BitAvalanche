* This algorithm uses bit avalanche technology, so that the encrypted ciphertext becomes very large until infinity.
* A password can be used infinitely without changing.
* Of course, there is no password too. However, there must be random numbers.
* The encryption algorithm of this program adopts the algorithm of "JunTai" distribution random number, but the decryption algorithm does not use it.
* The so-called "JunTai" distribution refers to the disorderly distribution of each number on the axis of the number, its value appears only once without repetition.

* It's just a demo version, with the official, enhanced and final versions.
* If you need source code, please contact me.
* I hope who can crack this algorithm one day in my lifetime.
* If you break this algorithm, please let me know, thank you very so much!
